# Features

### Random Pokémon Generation

Each time you start a game, a new Pokémon is fetched from the vast Pokémon universe. Will you guess a common Pokémon or stumble upon a rare gem?

### Shiny Pokémon:

You might encounter a <span style="color:gold;">shiny</span> Pokémon!

### Classic Hangman Experience

The Pokémon will escape if 6 incorrect guesses are made. But don't worry, you still have a chance to catch it in future encounters!

### Limited Pokéballs for Each Encounter

You only have 6 guesses before the Pokémon escapes. Use your knowledge of Pokémon to guess the letters in the name!

## How It Works

1. **Start the Game**: When you begin, a random Pokémon is selected. The name of the Pokémon is hidden, and you must guess it by selecting letters.
2. **Guess the Pokémon**: Use your knowledge of Pokémon to guess the letters in the name. Each incorrect guess brings you closer to losing the game, just like in traditional Hangman.
3. **Catch the Pokémon**: Successfully guess all the letters in the Pokémon's name to "catch" it. If you're lucky, you might catch a <span style="color:gold;">shiny</span> version!
