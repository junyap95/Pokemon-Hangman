## Hangman Game Rules

- The game is played by guessing the letters in a secret word chosen by the game.
- The player can guess one letter at a time, and must guess correctly to move forward.
- The number of allowed guesses is limited to 6.
- The game ends when the player guesses all the letters in the secret word or when the player runs out of guesses.
